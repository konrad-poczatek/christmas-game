Find an elements which is present in an array more than `length / 2` times.

**Samples:**
```
array: [1,2,3,3,3]
return: 3
```
```
array: [1,1,2,2,2,1,1]
return 1
```
```
array: [5,2,5]
return 5
```

**Assumptions:**
* array is constructed in such way there is always such element

**Hint:**
Find solution with O(1) time complexity
