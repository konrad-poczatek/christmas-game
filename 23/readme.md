There is an array of integers. Move all zeros to the end of the array without making a copy of the array.

**Samples**
```
array: [1,0,1,0,2,3,4,0,5]
result: [1,1,2,3,4,5,0,0,0]
```
```
array: [1,0,3,0,1,2,4]
result: [1,3,1,2,4,0,0]
```
```
array: [0]
result: [0]
```
```
array: [1]
result: [1]
```
```
array: [0,1]
result: [1,0]
```
```
array: [1,0]
result: [1,0]
```

**Speed hint:**
Could you minimize the total number of operations done?
