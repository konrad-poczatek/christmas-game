Again those prefixes!!

You receive an array of string: `strings`, and a string `word`.

Return number of prefixes in word `word` that exist in `string`.

**Samples**
```
strings: ["a","b","c","ab", "bc", "ac", "abc", "abcd"]
word: "abcd"
Result: 4 -> a, ab, abc, abcd are prefixes of abcd
```
```
string: ["b","b","c"]
word: "bb"
result: 2 -> "b" and "b" are prefixes of bb
```

**Assumption:**
* there are only lowercase English letters
* strings is not longer than 1k
* there are no words longer than 10 in strings and word
