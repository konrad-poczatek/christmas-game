**Description**
Check if an integer is palindrome. Palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards.
 

**Examples**:

```
Number = 12321

Output: true

Why: If you read 12321 from right to left you receive the same number.
```
---
```
Number = -12321

Output: false

Why: If you read -12321 from right to left you receive 12321- which is not the same.
```
---
```
Number = 20

Output: false

Why: If you read 20 backwards you receive 02, so it's not a palindrome.
```

**Assumptions**:

number is greater or equal -2<sup>31</sup> and lower or equal 2<sup>31</sup> - 1
