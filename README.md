# Christmas game
Christmas is coming so the game too. Let's see who is most PERSISTENT and EFFICIENT coder!
This game is going to improve our coding skills a little (or just refresh algorithms).

Every single day new task will be revealed till Christmas Eve. You can find task description in directory with day's number. The goal is to write algorithm (maybe even most efficient one) which solves given problem (sample is in `0` directory). 

To participate create branch with your name and merge master branch to yours every day, because new task appear every day.

## Rules
1. Create branch with your name
1. New problem will appear in a master branch every day in directory related to day of December.
1. Merge master to your branch so the new task appear there
1. Create solution with a file called solution with extension related to language we use in our daily basis (js, kotlin, java)
1. Only solutions pushed to named branch before the end of the day would be examined.
1. Solutions would be examined to check if they are correct and efficient.
1. There is 1 point for submitting correct solution and 1 additional point for most efficient solution
1. You would receive feedback if something is not correct.
1. Please do not cheat - it's just a fun game.

## Prizes
Rest of the team needs to add sufficient title prefix before asking winner for something tille the end of the year.
You can win one below tiles:
1. `Winner` for scoring the most points in this game (max 48 points). (and 50 EUR Amazon coupon)
1. `Persistent` for a person who commit algorithms everyday (max 24 points - one per day) (and 30 EUR Amazon coupon)
1. `Efficient` for a person who commit most efficient algorithms (max 24 points - one per most efficient algorightm during the day only for one person) (and 20 EUR Amazon coupon)

Let's say Pooja won the Christmas game then you need to title him per Winner Pooja till the end of the year.
