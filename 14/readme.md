Santa would like to visit as much children as he could during the Christmas Eve. He is planning to visit one street, but there's only one problem. 

Adjacent houses have connected security system. So if Santa visit two adjacent hosues then it would automatically contact police station, and Santa would like to avoid that.

You receive an array of children in each house. Return the maximum number of children Santa can visit withouth altering security systems.

**Samples:**
```
children = [1,2,3,4]
result = 6 -> visit second house with 2 children and last house with 4 children
```
```
children = [2,7,9,3,1]
result = 12 -> visit house with 2 children, then with 9 and with 1 kid.
```

**Assumptions:**
* array has minimum one house and maximum 100 houses
* number of children in one house is between 0 and 400.
